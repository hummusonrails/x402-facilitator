# Docker Compose .env File Fix

## Problem

Docker Compose automatically loads `.env` and tries to expand variables with `$`. 
Bcrypt hashes contain `$` which causes warnings like:
```
WARN[0000] The "hpp6Vp8p1WS15yqM9adKn" variable is not set
```

## Solution

Escape `$` symbols in bcrypt hashes by doubling them: `$$`

### Before (causes warnings):
```env
ADMIN_API_KEY_HASH=$2b$10$hpp6Vp8p1WS15yqM9adKn.pG5NTOr9WRZUclihLRrexxltYMyH0Hm
```

### After (no warnings):
```env
ADMIN_API_KEY_HASH=$$2b$$10$$hpp6Vp8p1WS15yqM9adKn.pG5NTOr9WRZUclihLRrexxltYMyH0Hm
```

## Quick Fix

Run this command to escape all `$` in your .env file:

```bash
# Backup first
cp .env .env.backup

# Escape $ symbols in ADMIN_API_KEY_HASH line
sed -i.bak 's/ADMIN_API_KEY_HASH=\$2b\$10\$/ADMIN_API_KEY_HASH=$$2b$$10$$/g' .env
```

Or manually edit `.env` and replace each `$` with `$$` in the hash value.

**Note:** The Node.js application will still read `$2b$10$...` correctly because it doesn't do variable expansion.
